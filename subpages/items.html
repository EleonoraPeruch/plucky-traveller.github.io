        <p class="card-text">Nellie Bly is a strong woman which was able to travel around the world in only 72 days. Which was not only remarkable in terms of speed for the year 1890 but was also a significant event for the 19th century because of her being a woman. The trip was inspired of Jules Venes(?) who wrote a book about a man circling the world in just under 80 days. (book by Jules) Jules was generally fascinated by geography and searched ways to include the geographical organisation of the world in his books. He was participating in the Society of Geography to discuss the most recent discoveries in geography. (bulletin of the society) The speed with which Nellie traveled was only possible with the modern means of transport, which were invented during the industrial revolution. (map depicting railway) The IR was a census for the whole cultural industry. (painting inspired by IR) During her journey, newspapers reported about the occurring event. (newspaper article) The way she was portrayed, was heavily influenced by the stereotypical role of woman. Her return was greeted with a celebration, in which ironically only men were allowed to participate. (wooden print of the return) Her success was later used as a theme for books and games. (board game) She herself wrote a book about the journey which was published within the same year. (audio book of the book written by Nellie) Nellie herself had a tendency to frame herself as an adventures and fearless woman. (image of Nellie waving) She certainly was so and is nowadays widely recognised for her inspiring characteristics.Her admirers include individuals and companies likewise. Many people are honouring her with artworks or with reconstructing her story. (Google Doodle)  </p>

            <p class="card-text">Elizabeth Cochran Seaman (May 5, 1864 – January 27, 1922), better known by her pen name, Nellie Bly, was an American journalist who was widely known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days, in emulation of Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg, and an exposé in which she worked undercover to report on a mental institution from within. She was a pioneer in her field, and launched a new kind of investigative journalism. Bly was also a writer, industrialist, inventor, and a charity worker.</p>
